GUI for Diskpart in Windows.


This is a simple GUI for Windows's Diskpart application.  

There currently aren't too many features, but I will add more in the future.  

Note: You must be running the script as admin otherwise it won't work.  

It can currently:

Assign or remove a drive letter from a volume.  
Display all of the volumes in the system.  
Show filesystem information of a volume.  
Show all of the disks in the system.
